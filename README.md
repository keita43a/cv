## Pagedown rendered CV

This repo is to make my CV using the pagedown rendered CV developed by [Nick Strayer](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv).

### Log

March 6, 2023: I found the developer developed a package for the pagedown rendered CV. I am updating according to the package. The new directry is "cv_package.R"

I tried to install the package, but I could not because "ERROR: dependency ‘icon’ is not available for package ‘datadrivencv’"
